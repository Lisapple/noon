_This is a complete game, not a tutorial; Don't create issue to ask question regarding the source code._

The project has been created with [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) 3.1 using GDScript (with most of static typing migration has been done) with no dependencies except [8SSEDT](https://github.com/Lisapple/8SSEDT) module only to re-generate distance maps.


Models have been created using Cheetah3D – I will certainly convert them to blender projects – and exported to Collada (`dae`) files.
